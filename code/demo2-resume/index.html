	        <p class="subtitle">Product Design / <span class="work-date">2015 - 2016</span></p>
	        <p class="content">The company I worked before provides the OEM service for foreign enterprises like Apple and Microsoft. I worked there as a product designer which needs to be in contact with workmates of every department. The workflow is shown as follows. <br />
1. I need to provide DFM(Design for Manufacture) report for the customers, which is made after the team members have a total discussion on the drawing and specification of a kind of product. The report contains various issues such as the tolerance, the material, the electronic parameters of the product. We will provide the customers with the reports till they are satisfied with the final proposals. <br />
2. I need to provide the customers with the procedure flowchart report which shows the process of cable assembly. <br />
3. I need to finish a bill of materials(BOM) and prepare for the sample making. <br />
4. I need to complete and release the BOM, drawings, standard packaging procedure in the PLM system. <br />
5. I also do the reliability test and make a report to work out the failure. <br />
I take part in two projects during my work.one is a test cable which includes two connectors. I completed the work of product engineering as I said before. The other one is composed of four cables with six kinds of connectors used in the latest notebooks.</p>

            <p class="content">I have studied in my alma mater for 4 years, which gave me not just hard study or leisure life but the-whole-life friendship, passions to think and act about anything. I got some superficial view on my major. I appreciated that I can go through these four years with those courses and friends, so that I can be more ambitious and aggressive than anytime before.</p>
